    "name" : "active regions",
    "description" : "A disturbed volume of the Sun's atmosphere that often consists of (from bottom to top) sunspots, plage, prominences, and hot magnetized loops. Active regions may release significant amounts of energy during magnetic eruptions that produce coronal mass ejections and/or flares."

    "id" : 14,
    "name" : "Corotating Interaction Region (CIR)",
    "description" : "Corotating interaction regions are zones of enhanced solar wind plasma density and interplanetary magnetic field that result from a region of slow solar wind (ahead) being compressed by fast solar wind behind it. In Earth's reference frame these enhanced regions sweep by, often creating small to moderate geomagnetic disturbances for a few to tens of hours."

    "name" : "CME Coronal Mass Ejection",
    "description" : "Coronal Mass Ejection - An eruption in the outer solar atmosphere that sends billions of tons of magnetized plasma clouds into interplanetary space. When traveling at high speeds these ejections create shocks in the solar wind. Earth-intercept of a CME is often followed by a geomagnetic storm."
